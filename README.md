# Godot Stairs

This is an implementation of stair stepping based on [Shifty's Godot Character Movement Manifesto](https://markdownpastebin.com/?id=d9d61e67f9d64db2bd215f165b931449) and [Collision Response: How to Climb a Staircase Properly](https://thelowrooms.xyz/articledir/programming_stepclimbing.php).

[TrenchBroom](https://github.com/TrenchBroom/TrenchBroom) and [Qodot](https://github.com/QodotPlugin/qodot-plugin) are used for map building.

[Kenney's Prototype Textures](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/prototype-textures) is used for texturing.

[Garbaj FPS Controller](https://github.com/GarbajYT/godot_updated_fps_controller) is used for basic movement.
